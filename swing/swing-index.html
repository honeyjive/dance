	<h4 class="dance-detail">East Coast Swing</h3>
		<p class="description">
			East Coast Swing, also called Jitterbug Swing, is often the beginner's introduction to the swing step. The basic footwork is described as "step, step, rock step." The dancers (leader and follower) step with one foot, to the other, and end with a rock step. The steps are then repeated in time with the music with Leaders beginning with their left foot and followers mirroring with their right. This dance can also be danced with a triple step, or adding an additional side step when alternating feet; the rock step remains the same.

Typically danced to swing and jazz music, it incorporates both solo and partnered patterns. As a city rich with music, it is easy to find an event or venue where lindy hoppers can move to their favorite tunes.

	<h4 class="dance-detail">Blues & Fusion</h3>
		<p class="description">
			Many swing moves and steps meld and can be applied between dance styles. Blues is a style which mixes swing moves and improvization. This dance allows a large amount of flexibility because it allows the dancer to use different dance steps/movements according to the beat, speed, and/or feel of the music. Like all partner dances, partner connection is important. Mirroring and syncing moves are common, and can sometimes involve close physical proximity.

		<p class="description">
			Fusion is a broad term when describing mixing different dance styles or dancing a certain style to music not typically associated with the dance. Blues fusion is quite popular as it mixes west coast swing and blues to be danced to songs from slow bluesy tunes to salsa music to Top 40.
