<!-- Brief overall description -->
<p>
	Sultry, sassy, and sexy, Latin dances are a fun favorite among Austinites. Salsa is the most popular in the social Latin dance scene, but is quickly followed by Bachata, Merengue, and many others. Music danced in this genre contains influences from all over Latin America as well some African rhythms.
