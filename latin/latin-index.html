<!-- Brief overall description -->
<p class="description">
	Sultry, sassy, and sexy, Latin dances are a fun favorite among Austinites. Salsa is the most popular in the social Latin dance scene, but is quickly followed by Bachata, Merengue, and many others. Music danced in this genre contains influences from all over Latin America as well some African rhythms.

<h3 class="dance-detail">Salsa</h3>
	<p class="description">
		There are many venues in Austin that have both live and DJ'ed music for salsa dancing. The basic involves the dancer to move his or her weight with a step back or forward--depending on whoever is the lead or follow--in a 3-step movement. Salsa can be danced in an open or closed position with accompanied patterns involving turns, spins, body rolls, and even dips.

<h3 class="dance-detail">Bachata</h3>
	<p class="description">
		Bachata is a enjoyable and unique dance due to the particular beat found in bachata music. Bachata steps typically have a side to side motion that is ended with a hip "pop" on an accented beat. Like salsa, this dance can be done in an open or closed position. However, in social dancing, the closed position can be dancer closer like an embrace.

<h3 class="dance-detail">Merengue</h3>
	<p class="description">
		One of the easiest but no less entertaining is the Merengue. The steps for Merengue is a marching step to the beat. Due to the simple step, dancers can easily add their own style and movements.
